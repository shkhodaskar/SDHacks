# Executable Debugger
![Home Screen](/images/HOME_SCREEN.png)

This program enables a user to input a file into our webapp. We execute the file in an AWS virtual machine instance and generate a log file of the running processes in the executable. The log file is generated on the screen to help experienced developers make an informed decision.

## Why Did We Make This Developer Tool?
